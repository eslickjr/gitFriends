  You'll pull down the repository and type npm i in the terminal while in the root directory. You'll then type npm run build followed by npm run start. From there, you can start hitting the api with whatever api client you are using at localhost:3001.
  ## Usage
  There are multitude of endpoints built around Users and thoughts. You can create, get, update, delete, and add/remove friends with the User endpoints and with the thoughts endpoints, you can create, get, update, delete, and add/remove reactions. A thought can't be created without a userId to tie it to. You can find a full video of the usage here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EN5lddDtX1cD9MqYkcRHamgVL4G6KpOe/view
